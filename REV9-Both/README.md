There were two Rev9s, the first one (SMD) was made with fusion-360, and another with kicad

I choose to switch to kicad so anyone could build upon the work I did. Kicad Is Free and open source. Fusion-360 is "free" for students , but anyone who has dealt with

software knows there's a bit difference between a link to download immedately and like a "fill out this form and make an account and yada yada."

Fusion-360 is also cloud based and really doesnt like you to save things to disk. Cloud based in my opinion is garbage, and It's an element of control.

Fusion-360 is also just pretty bad software in my opinion. Dont get my wrong it's ok, but like, I want my software to be good for life, and never ask me to sign in or connect to wifi, or say I need to update etc.

Fusion also loads really slow, which is infuriating when you want to make small changes. Kicad loads in less than 1 second on my computer.
