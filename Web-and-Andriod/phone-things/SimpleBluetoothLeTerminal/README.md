# SimpleBluetoothLeTerminal

This Android app provides a line-oriented terminal / console for Bluetooth LE (4.x) devices implementing a custom serial profile

For an overview on Android BLE communication see 
[Android Bluetooth LE Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth/ble-overview).

In contrast to classic Bluetooth, there is no predefined serial profile for Bluetooth LE, 
so each vendor uses GATT services with different service and characteristic UUIDs.

This app includes UUIDs for widely used serial profiles:
- Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822  
- Texas Instruments CC254x
- Microchip RN4870/1
- Telit Bluemod

## Motivation

I got various requests asking for help with Android development or source code for my
[Serial Bluetooth Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal) app.
Here you find a simplified version of my app.
