This repo includes the code for the esp32-C3-DEVKITC-02 that fits into the MIT NSE Geiger counters. It also includes a web app and andriod app that currently work.

we use gpio 4 on the esp

You may have to do some things to make the web app work on google (will add more about this when making tutorial of how to use everything)

Thank you to Rui & Sara Santos, Kai morich, and Neil Kolban for providing example code to work from
