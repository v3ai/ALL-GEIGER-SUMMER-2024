The SBM-20, while a great tube is becoming increasingly difficult to source.

I've said it before, but the main problem is if say someone wanted to build 1000 of the MIT-NSE Geiger counters, the main bottle neck there

would be just getting the tubes. World events with russia and ukraine have made this more dificult, and it's unclear who manufactures the sbm-20 nowadays (date codes for 2022 or 2012 exist)

There are a a few possible solutions



1. Getting Reproduction SBM-20's made

I contacted the company LND (manufacturer of geiger tubes)

https://www.lndinc.com/

info@lndinc.com

To make SBM-20 reproducitons

I was specifically in contact with 

BILL LEHNERT, SALES MANAGER

LND seems to be one of the only remaining geiger tube manufacturers in the united states

After a few messages back and fourth they proivided me with the included PDF engineering drawing of
a SBM-20 that they would be capable producing

They will be closed until August 12th

People love the SBM-20 and are willing to pay $50! on amazon per tube!!! outrageous, possible good idea to sell reproductions for cheaper than that

Might be able to sell SBM-20 Reproductions to GQ Electronigs, good modern geiger counter manufacturer
	

2. Using the M4011/J321 tubes ~88mm x ~10mm

Suprisingly a good tube, didn't expect it, but after trying it out, it works fairly similarly to the sbm-20



3. Using the Gamma-7C SBM-20 reproduction https://consensus-group.ru/radiation-counters/gamma-radiation/256-gamma-7c

(they're also russia based, but atleast we know poople are making SBM reproductions)

company seemed pretty eh

appartently you can buy some here https://ekosf.ru/product/gamma-7ts/



I made a few posts about the gamma 7c that can be found here and here

someone also mentioned the J305 with a metal case, althoug I haven't tried or
really considered this tube
