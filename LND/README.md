I contacted the company LND (manufacturer of geiger tubes)

https://www.lndinc.com/

info@lndinc.com

To make SBM-20 reproducitons

I was specifically in contact with 

BILL LEHNERT, SALES MANAGER

LND seems to be one of the only remaining geiger tube manufacturers in the united states

After a few messages back and fourth they proivided me with the included PDF engineering drawing of
a SBM-20 that they would be capable producing

They will be closed until August 12th
