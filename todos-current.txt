REV-10 Is the last stable board, REV-11 is quite experimental and removed the potentiometer, and the second mosfet, it should be determined if these need to be added back for the next rev, or just stick with REV-10 and
dont worry about it.




To Do Current:

check all parts got here from digikey (for the 30 pcs assembly)

fix double count bug in apps

maybe make android app somewhat more tailored, not just basic terminal

make it so the andriod app esp code transmits numbers instead of strings

re factor esp code and remove un-needed things

find out if wifi with the esp-32 works (current spike might be a problem)

fix labels off center printing






To Do More long term:

Ask micro center if they'd like to carry the kits

Look Out for email from LND

Add Things back to next revs, Potentiometer, Second mosfet maybe?





To Do For Rev 11:

Figure out why Mosfet is heating up Rev 11

figure out which resistor cap combo is best for the rev 11
